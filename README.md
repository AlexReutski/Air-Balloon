# Air-Balloon

Mini game for mobiles and browsers

Working title: Air Balloon
Genre: Runner
Plot: A balloon flies through the desert above the power line, and periodically appears on the towers (kittens, coins, or fuel tanks (not yet decided).) Touching the wires damages the ball.

Goal: collect coins / rescue the kittens / pick up fuel tanks to replenish the stock.

- if the coins - the more coins collected, the better.
- if the kittens - the more the kittens saved, the better (unlike the coins, the emotional component).
- if the fuel tanks - add a scale with fuel that decreases with time, the collected fuel tanks increase the duration of the flight, otherwise the balloon falls on the wires and the game ends. It is necessary to add a distance scale.

Control: the balloon flies at a constant speed, gradually dropping (not yet decided). The user can raise up or pull down the balloon (imitation of the heat supply to the air balloon)
